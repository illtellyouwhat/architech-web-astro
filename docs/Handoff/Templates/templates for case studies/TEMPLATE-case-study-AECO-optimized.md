## Our Approach [OPTIONAL - Use only for cases with proprietary methodology]

### [Name of Proprietary Method/Architecture]

[2-3 paragraph explanation of WHY this approach is different and WHY it matters]

[First paragraph: Explain the standard approach and its limitations]

**Example for Dual-LLM:**
> Most AI patient matching systems use a single LLM, which introduces 10-15% hallucination risk in medical contexts. Single-LLM systems can confidently provide incorrect assessments with no validation mechanism.

[Second paragraph: Explain your approach]

**Example for Dual-LLM:**
> We built a dual-LLM verification architecture where:
> 
> - **Primary LLM** evaluates patient eligibility against trial criteria
> - **Secondary LLM** independently verifies the primary assessment
> - **Discrepancy Detection** flags conflicting assessments for human review
> - **Confidence Scoring** assigns reliability scores to each determination

[Third paragraph: Explain the unique benefit/outcome]

**Example for Dual-LLM:**
> This architecture achieved 99% reduction in hallucinations compared to single-LLM approaches. In healthcare contexts where false positives can delay trial recruitment or expose patients to inappropriate trials, this verification layer is critical for both accuracy and regulatory compliance.

**When to include "Our Approach" section:**
- âœ… Dual-LLM verification (Clinical Trial case)
- âœ… Custom scheduling algorithm (Manufacturing case - if algorithm has unique features)
- âœ… Multi-platform normalization pipeline (Ad Reporting case - if approach is distinctive)
- âŒ Standard integrations (Email Campaign case - Zapier + APIs is not proprietary)
- âŒ Content strategy (Content Strategy case - data-driven approach is standard practice)

**Structure:**
- Explain standard approach limitations (1 paragraph)
- Explain your approach with technical specifics (bullet list + 1 paragraph)
- Explain unique benefit with quantified outcome (1 paragraph)

## Impact

### Before & After [OPTIONAL - Use for metrics-heavy cases]

| Metric | Before Automation | After Automation | Improvement |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| [Primary metric] | [Before value] | [After value] | [% or X improvement] |
| [Secondary metric] | [Before value] | [After value] | [% or X improvement] |
| [Tertiary metric] | [Before value] | [After value] | [% or X improvement] |
| [Quality metric] | [Before value] | [After value] | [% or X improvement] |

**When to use Before/After table:**
- âœ… Manufacturing (scheduling time, conflicts, response time)
- âœ… Ad Reporting (manual hours, error costs, report generation time)
- âœ… Email Campaign (error rate, refund costs, manual hours)
- âŒ Clinical Trial (capacity increase is clear without table)
- âŒ Content Strategy (growth metrics don't need before/after structure)

**Table Guidelines:**
- Include 3-5 key metrics that tell the complete story
- Use specific numbers, not vague descriptions
- Include quality metrics (accuracy, errors) alongside time savings
- Add "N/A" for new capabilities that didn't exist before

---

### [Impact Category 1 - e.g., Time Savings]

- [Specific measurable result with numbers]
- [Another quantified outcome]
- [Third outcome or benefit]

### [Impact Category 2 - e.g., Quality Improvements]

- [Specific improvement 1]
- [Specific improvement 2]
- [Specific improvement 3]

### [Impact Category 3 - e.g., Business Outcomes]

- [Business result 1]
- [Business result 2]
- [Business result 3]
- [Business result 4]

### [Optional: Impact Category 4 - e.g., New Capabilities]

- [New capability 1 that wasn't possible before]
- [New capability 2 that wasn't possible before]
- [New capability 3 that wasn't possible before]

**Impact Section Guidelines:**
- Start with time/cost savings (most tangible)
- Follow with quality improvements
- End with strategic/business outcomes
- Use specific numbers wherever possible
- Include both efficiency gains AND new capabilities

---

## Technical Highlights

[List 8-12 technical details or architecture decisions]

**Standard format (bullet list):**
- [Technical detail or architecture decision 1]
- [Technical detail or architecture decision 2]
- [Technical detail or architecture decision 3]
- [Technical detail or architecture decision 4]
- [Technical detail or architecture decision 5]
- [Technical detail or architecture decision 6]
- [Technical detail or architecture decision 7]
- [Technical detail or architecture decision 8]

**AECO Enhancement: Expand 2-3 key bullets into sentences**

**Example - Standard bullet:**
> - Multi-platform API integration with Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and programmatic networks

**Example - Expanded for depth:**
> - **Multi-platform API integration** with Google Ads, Facebook Ads, and programmatic networks. Built custom retry logic to handle rate limits and quota restrictions across platforms with different API architectures. Implemented incremental data updates to minimize API quota usage while maintaining real-time accuracy.

**When to expand bullets:**
1. Proprietary or unique technical approaches (dual-LLM, custom algorithms)
2. Complex integrations that required creative solutions (API workarounds, data normalization)
3. Technical achievements that differentiate from competitors (performance, scale, accuracy)

**Which bullets to expand:**
- Choose 2-3 bullets that demonstrate technical sophistication
- Focus on "how we solved hard problems" not "what technologies we used"
- Expand bullets that technical buyers would care about (CTOs, VPs Engineering)
- Leave simpler bullets as-is (standard integrations, common patterns)

**Technical Highlights Guidelines:**
- Include specific platform/technology names (not just "we integrated systems")
- Mention scale indicators (millions of data points, sub-second queries, 27 machines)
- Note technical constraints overcome (API limitations, data normalization challenges)
- Include compliance/security where relevant (HIPAA, data encryption)
- Balance accessibility (explain acronyms in context) with technical credibility

---

## Key Learnings [OPTIONAL - Include if insights are valuable]

- [Project insight or lesson learned 1]
- [Project insight or lesson learned 2]
- [Project insight or lesson learned 3]
- [Project insight or lesson learned 4]
- [Project insight or lesson learned 5]

**Key Learnings Guidelines:**
- Include genuine insights that would help other organizations (not platitudes)
- Focus on non-obvious lessons (not "planning is important")
- Include technical learnings (API rate limits, data normalization challenges)
- Include process learnings (parallel deployment, user feedback timing)
- Include strategic learnings (what drove most value, what was less important than expected)

**Good examples:**
- âœ… "API rate limits required careful planning for multi-platform integrations - we built retry logic and quota monitoring"
- âœ… "Real-time alerts drove more value than perfect historical reporting - clients cared more about prevention than analysis"
- âœ… "Parallel deployment strategy built team confidence during transition - two weeks of dual-run eliminated adoption resistance"

**Weak examples:**
- âŒ "User feedback is important"
- âŒ "Planning ahead saves time"
- âŒ "Communication is key to success"

3. **Fill remaining slots** - Use highest `order` (priority) cases to fill remaining slots

**Example:**
```yaml
# Current case: Manufacturing + Process Automation
relatedCases: 
  - "clinical-trial-patient-matching"    # Different industry, different solution
  - "ad-performance-reporting"           # Different industry, same solution (Data Integration)
  - "email-campaign-link-management"     # Different industry, same solution (Process Automation)
```
