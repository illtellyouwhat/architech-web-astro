## Content Structure Guidelines

### Introduction (150-250 words)

**Purpose:** Hook the reader and promise value

**Structure:**
1. **Hook (1 paragraph):** Start with the pain point or question
2. **Context (1 paragraph):** Explain why this matters
3. **Roadmap (1 paragraph):** Preview what they'll learn

**Good example:**
> "If you're spending 8+ hours every week building production schedules in Excel, you're not alone. We've worked with dozens of manufacturers facing the same bottleneck—production managers drowning in manual scheduling while machines sit idle waiting for updated plans.
> 
> This isn't just a time problem. Manual scheduling limits your ability to respond to rush orders, optimize capacity utilization, or scale operations. The opportunity cost is measured in thousands of lost production hours annually.
> 
> In this post, we'll show you how manufacturers are cutting scheduling time by 87.5% using low-code automation tools. You'll learn the decision framework for choosing between off-the-shelf software and custom solutions, see real implementation examples, and get a step-by-step evaluation checklist."

**Bad example:**
> "Production scheduling is important for manufacturers. Many companies struggle with this. In this post, we'll discuss automation solutions."

**Quick Takeaway:**
- One sentence summarizing the main point for skimmers
- Appears after introduction, before main content
- Allows answer engines to extract key insight quickly

---

### Main Content Sections (H2s)

**How Many Sections:** 3-5 major sections (H2s) per post

**Section Length:** 300-500 words per major section

**Structure Pattern:**
- **H2:** Main topic or question
- **Opening paragraph:** Set context for this section
- **H3s:** Break down into specific aspects (2-4 H3s per H2)
- **Examples/Evidence:** Real-world illustration of concept

**Featured Snippet Targeting:**

Many sections should include a **"The Short Answer"** subsection (H3) positioned early:

```markdown
### The Short Answer

[40-60 word paragraph directly answering the question]
```

**Why this works:**
- Google prioritizes concise, direct answers for featured snippets
- Answer engines cite clear, quotable statements
- Human readers appreciate getting the answer upfront before diving into details

**Example:**
```markdown
## How Much Does Production Scheduling Automation Cost?

### The Short Answer

Low-code production scheduling solutions typically range from $5,000-$25,000 for implementation, with $200-$1,000 monthly licensing fees. Custom solutions start at $50,000 but offer greater flexibility. Most manufacturers see ROI within 6-12 months through time savings and capacity optimization.

### Breaking Down the Costs

[Detailed explanation...]
```

---

### Lists and Bullet Points

**When to use bullets:**
- Key points or takeaways
- Step-by-step processes
- Pros/cons comparisons
- Requirements or criteria lists

**When to use numbered lists:**
- Sequential steps in a process
- Ranked options (best to worst)
- Chronological events

**Bullet/List Guidelines:**
- Each bullet should be 1-2 sentences (not just fragments)
- Start with strong action verbs or clear nouns
- Make bullets parallel in structure
- Aim for 3-7 bullets per list (not too few, not overwhelming)

**Good example:**
- **Identify bottlenecks:** Review your current scheduling process and note where the production manager spends the most time—typically job assignment, capacity calculation, or schedule distribution.
- **Quantify impact:** Calculate how many hours per week are spent on manual scheduling and what that costs in terms of delayed responses to rush orders or missed optimization opportunities.
- **Evaluate alternatives:** Compare off-the-shelf scheduling software ($200-1K/month) against custom low-code solutions ($5-25K implementation) based on your specific requirements.

**Bad example:**
- Identify bottlenecks
- Quantify impact
- Evaluate alternatives

---

### Examples and Case Study References

**Every major point should include:**
- Real-world example (anonymized if needed)
- Specific details (numbers, timelines, outcomes)
- Link to full case study when relevant

**Structure:**
```markdown
**Example from our work:** [Brief description]

[2-3 sentences with specific details and metrics]

**Read the full case study:** [Link to case study page]
```

**Good example:**
> **Example from our work:** A $60M paper manufacturer was spending 8 hours per week on Excel-based production scheduling across 27 machines.
> 
> We implemented a low-code scheduling system integrated with their ERP. The automated scheduling engine reduced manual work to 1 hour per week (87.5% reduction) and enabled the production manager to respond to rush orders in under 2 hours instead of 24+ hours.
>

### FAQ Section (Answer Engine Gold Mine)

**Purpose:** 
- Answer common related questions
- Target "People Also Ask" boxes in Google
- Provide citeable content for answer engines

**Format:**
```markdown
## Common Questions

### [Question phrased exactly as people ask it]?

[40-60 word direct answer]

[Optional: 1-2 paragraphs of additional context]
```

**Question Sources:**
- Google "People Also Ask" boxes for your target keyword
- Customer questions from sales calls
- Support ticket common questions
- Reddit/forum discussions in your industry

**Example:**
```markdown
### How long does it take to implement production scheduling automation?

Low-code solutions typically deploy in 6-8 weeks including requirements gathering, configuration, testing, and training. Custom solutions require 3-6 months. Timeline depends on ERP integration complexity and number of machines/operators. Most manufacturers see immediate time savings upon deployment.

For complex environments with 50+ machines or multiple facilities, expect 10-12 weeks for low-code and 6-9 months for custom development. The key variable is ERP integration—cloud-based ERPs with modern APIs integrate faster than legacy on-premise systems.
```

**FAQ Guidelines:**
- Include 3-6 questions per post
- Use natural question phrasing (not robotic)
- Answer directly in first paragraph (40-60 words)
- Add context in subsequent paragraphs if needed
- Link to related content where relevant

---

### Key Takeaways Section

**Purpose:** Summarize main points for skimmers

**Format:**
- 4-6 bullet points
- Each bullet: **Bold main point** followed by one-sentence elaboration

**Example:**
```markdown
## Key Takeaways

- **87.5% time reduction is achievable:** Manufacturers we've worked with consistently reduce scheduling time from 8 hours to 1 hour per week using low-code automation.
- **ERP integration is critical:** Automated scheduling only works if it pulls live data from your existing systems—standalone tools create more problems than they solve.
- **ROI within 6-12 months:** Most implementations pay for themselves through time savings alone, before accounting for capacity optimization and faster rush order response.
- **Low-code beats custom for standard processes:** Unless you have highly specialized requirements, low-code platforms deploy 4x faster and cost 60% less than custom development.
- **Change management matters more than technology:** The best automation fails if your team doesn't adopt it—involve production managers and shift supervisors from day one.
```
